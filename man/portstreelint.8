.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility checks the FreeBSD port tree Index
and some part of the port's Makefiles for errors and warnings.
.Pp
By default it will scan the whole port tree, but you can select
a subset of the ports with the options
.Op Fl \-cat|\-c
for categories,
.Op Fl \-mnt|\-m
for maintainers and
.Op Fl \-port|\-p
for ports.
All these options expect a parameter which can be a single item
or a comma\-separated list of items.
If you combine several of these operators they will perform as
a logical AND.
.Pp
In order to know which categories or maintainers are available
for selection, you can use the
.Op Fl \-show\-cat|\-C
and
.Op Fl \-show\-mnt|\-M
options to view all the categories and maintainers with their
number of associated ports.
.Pp
The two costlier analysis are disabled by default.
You can check if the port's www sites hostnames are resolvable
with the
.Op Fl \-check\-host|\-h
option (takes about 15 minutes on the
whole port tree).
And you can check if the port's www sites URL are available
with the
.Op Fl \-check\-url|\-u
option, which implies the previous one
(takes about 6 hours on the whole port tree).
.Pp

.Op Fl \-unchanged
options, followed by a number of files for the first
one and a number of days for the others.

Options processing terminator
.Sh FILES
The whole port tree under
.Pa /usr/ports
\- as root, get the last version with "portsnap fetch update"
.Pp
.Pa /usr/ports/INDEX\-xx
\- where xx is the major version of FreeBSD that you are using (as I write this xx=14).
As root, get the last version with "cd /usr/ports ; make fetchindex"
or rebuild it from your port tree with "cd /usr/ports ; make index"
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std portstreelint
.Sh EXAMPLES
To analyze the full port tree (takes a long time!), do:
.Bd -literal
$ nohup portstreelint \-\-info \-hu > stdout.txt 2> stderr.txt &
.Ed
.Pp
To analyze the ports of a specific maintainer identified by id@domain, do:
.Bd -literal
$ portstreelint \-\-info \-m id@domain
.Ed

.Xr portlint 1 ,

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is not a standard UNIX command.
.Pp
This implementation tries to follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
.Sh PORTABILITY
None. Works only on FreeBSD, but who needs anything else?
.Sh HISTORY
While working on the 4th version of the pysec2vuxml tool,
I noticed there were errors in the FreeBSD port Index,
so I built the
.Em portlint2
tool to analyze this more thoroughly...
.Pp
After discussions on the freebsd\-ports mailing list
an interest in checking port vulnerabilities arose,
which led me to convert that standalone command
into a Python package in order to benefit from my
.Em vuxml
library.
.Sh LICENSE
It is available under the 3\-clause BSD license.
